      # Configuration

      Your application / package is configured with the `mint.json` file (which
      is a [JSON] file). It defines the root of the application / project.

      [JSON]: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON"

      An example `mint.json` file of looks like this:

      ```json
      {
        "name": "my-app",
        "source-directories": [
          "source"
        ],
        "dependencies": {
          "mint-codemirror": {
            "repository": "https://github.com/mint-lang/mint-codemirror",
            "constraint": "5.0.0 <= v < 6.0.0"
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      > All the fields are validated so if something is not right you will get
      a nice error message!

      Here are all the possible fields (dot notation denotes a nested object):

      #{table}

      ## Dependencies

      The dependencies array contains all the packages that your application
      needs.

      Each is an object that has a:

      * `repository` field pointing to Git repository which uniquely
        identifies
      * `constraint` field that is the version information in one of
        two formats:

        * `0.0.0 <= v < 1.0.0` where the `v` is the resolvable version
        * `master:1.0.0` where the first part is the Git reference (of a
          branch, commit hash or tag) followed by a colon and the version the
        package should resolve as this is necessary because the version is
        only specified by tags.
