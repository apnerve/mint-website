          <<#MARKDOWN(highlight)
          Mint is a type-safe programming language for writing single page
          applications. In this post, we will take a look at what's new in the
          release `0.27.0`.

          In this release we added a feature to pass values to child components
          using context, quality of life changes for `if` expressions and
          some bug fixes.

          ## Context

          [Context] allows you to pass values to child components without using
          properties in a type safe way, no matter how deep the child is in the
          component tree. You can think about it as a kind of dependency
          injection.

          They are usually used to pass theme or form data around.

          #{contextExample}

          [Context]: /reference/components/context

          ## Quality of life changes for `if`

          There are some instances where you want to check if a `Maybe` or a
          `Result` has a value. Currently you can [destructure] it to get the
          value:

          ```mint
          let value =
            Maybe.Just("Hello World!")

          if let Just(value) = value {
            // value is now unboxed
          }
          ```

          Now you don't need to destructure, the compiler will unbox the value
          for you:

          ```mint
          let value =
            Maybe.Just("Hello World!")

          if value {
            // value is now unboxed here
          }
          ```

          Also, you can pass a `Maybe`, `Result` or `Html` as the condition, and
          then it will check if they are truthy (`Mybe.Just`, `Result.Ok` or
          the `Html` has any content):

          ```mint
          if Html.isNotEmpty(value) { /* value is not empty */ }
          if value { /* value is not empty */ }

          if Maybe.isJust(value) { /* value is `Maybe.Just` */ }
          if value { /* value is `Maybe.Just` */ }

          if Maybe.isOk(value) { /* value is `Result.Ok` */ }
          if value { /* value is `Result.Ok` */ }
          ```

          The latter versions seem more intuitive to many, and I whished a lot
          of times for this feature and not have gotten around to implement it.

          ## What's next?

          We continue on fixing bugs and issues that come up and working on
          GitHub issues before 1.0.0.
