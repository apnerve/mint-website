        `If` expressions can have a `let` statement with a pattern instead of
        the usual boolean condition.

        ```mint
        if let Just(value) = Maybe.Just("Hello") {
          // The destructuring is successfull...
        } else {
          // The destructuring if unsuccessfull...
        }
        ```

        In that case, the main branch is only returned if the pattern matches
        the given value. All destructured variables are available in the main
        branch.

        This is basically a syntax sugar for a two branch `case` expression,
        however, there are some cases where it's useful to have less
        indentation or to omit the else branch.
