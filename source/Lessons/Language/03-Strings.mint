        A `String` represents a sequence of characters, they are created with
        string literals using quotes `""`:

        ```mint
        "A single line string!"

        "A multline line string
        An other line"
        ```

        Strings can be broken apart with the `\` operator:

        ```mint
        "First line" \
        "Second line" \
        "Third line" == "First lineSecond lineThird line"
        ```

        Strings can be concatenated with the `+` operator:

        ```mint
        ("Hello" + " World" + "!") == "Hello World!"
        ```

        Other values can be interpolated into strings using interpolation:

        ```mint
        let name =
          "World"

        "Hello \#{name}!" == "Hello World!"
        ```

        Since Mint is a strongly typed language, you can only interpolate other
        `String` or `Number` typed values (numbers are implicitly converted to
        string). If you try to use something else, you will get a nice error
        message.
